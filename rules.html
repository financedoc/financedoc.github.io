<h1>Rules for Drafting Rules</h1>

<div class="row">

  <div class="itembox col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sd-12">
    <div class="itemtitle">Rule 1</div>
      <p>The first rule of rule drafting is to make the common case fast.  Remember that the rule is intended to facilitate a large number of transactions and most of them can readily be classified accrding to a set of standard criteria.  Collectively, the rules must identify the set of fast cases and make them as frictionless as possible. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="itembox col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sd-12">
    <div class="itemtitle seconditem">Rule 2 </div>
      <p>The second rule for writing rules is to develop a modularity plan and adhere to it strictly.  Each rule, and each subcomponent recursively, should have a clearly defined and singular purpose. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="itembox col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sd-12">
    <div class="itemtitle thirditem">Rule 3</div>
      <p>The third rule for rule-wrtiting is to use simple, transparent syntax, minimizing any jargon and complex linquistic constructs, avoiding cross references except where necessary, and never using a separate definition section for a term that is only used once or twice. </p>
